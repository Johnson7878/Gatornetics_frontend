            Account creation will come with several benefits in the future. For example, a Gatornetics user might want
            to upload their own data to run in our machine learning models. Without an account, this data would be 
            lost after leaving Gatornetics and the user would have to reupload it every time.

            Team talent scores are based upon current recruit rankings that are then processed into a gaussian distribution. This distribution takes higher-ranked recruit scores and fully sums them with lower-ranked recruit scores (that are adjusted). Lower-ranked recruit scores are multiplied with a percentage value based upon their rating as a result of the sample difference between them and higher-ranked players.

            Our predictions and their calculations will vary depending on which outcome you are trying to predict. However, a general strategy that we use as a metric includes loss-estimations that are captured during training. Additionally, we use coefficient scores as a means of determining useful features that are input into our model. Once weâ€™ve utilized these measures and determined our output, we compare results with existing entities that have calculated similar results with their frameworks.

            Since we are pulling data from free sources, we are limited in terms of the depth of information/statistics that we are provided. Offensive/defensive linemen and younger players will often have no/little information as a result of the complexity of gathering data on their position or their lack of playing time.

            Team offensive/defensive scores are calculated from a cumulation of several different statistics (each unique to offense/defense) and are then summed/averaged.
